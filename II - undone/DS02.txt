Second job was my first Fiverr job from Tim the "excel_hero". Had to scrape the search results on a gig website
for data (about 10,000 gigs). Script is done, runs 3 hours long though plus some mistakes in the review/response time/delivery time part due
to some of the latter gigs which only got one so it confuses the code. Didnt fix it, sent it to Tim and let him figure it out. 
So far most of it is done. Cool job.
